                Pop is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern
                form during the mid-1950s in the United States and the United
                Kingdom. The terms popular music and pop music are often used
                interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is
                popular and includes many disparate styles. During the 1950s and
                1960s, pop music encompassed rock and roll and the
                youth-oriented styles it influenced. Rock and pop music remained
                roughly synonymous until the late 1960s, after which pop became
                associated with music that was more commercial, ephemeral, and
                accessible. Although much of the music that appears on record
                charts is seen as pop music, the genre is distinguished from
                chart music. Identifying factors usually include repeated
                choruses and hooks, short to medium-length songs written in a
                basic format and rhythms or tempos that can be easily danced to.
                Much pop music also borrows elements from other styles such as
                rock, urban, dance, Latin, and country.

                Rock music is one of the most enjoyed genre in the music world.
                The genre had originated in early 1950s and continued its pace
                throughout the world of music. As the music developed it went
                through different phases of evolution giving birth to new
                genres. So far the Rock genre has developed more than 240 new
                genres, creating a huge world of its own. Some of those genres,
                like Heavy Metal have their own subgenres. The Rock music was
                heavily influenced by music such as Blues, Country, Pop and
                Classical. Almost all of types of rock music are popular in the
                world.

                Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that
                developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the
                United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock,
                psychedelic rock, and acid rock, heavy metal bands developed a
                thick, massive sound, characterized by distortion, extended
                guitar solos, emphatic beats, and loudness. The lyrics and
                performances are sometimes associated with aggression and
                machismo. In 1968, three of the genre's most famous pioneers,
                Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and Deep Purple, were founded.
                Though they came to attract wide audiences, they were often
                derided by critics. Several American bands modified heavy metal
                into more accessible forms during the 1970s: the raw, sleazy
                sound and shock rock of Alice Cooper and Kiss; the blues-rooted
                rock of Aerosmith; and the flashy guitar leads and wild party
                rock of Van Halen. During the mid-1970s, Judas Priest helped
                spur the genre's evolution by discarding much of its blues
                influence, while Motörhead introduced a punk rock sensibility
                and an increasing emphasis on speed. Beginning in the late
                1970s, bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron
                Maiden and Saxon followed in a similar vein. By the end of the
                decade, heavy metal fans became known as "metalheads" or
                "headbangers". During the 1980s, glam metal became popular with
                groups such as Bon Jovi and Mötley Crüe. Underground scenes
                produced an array of more aggressive styles: thrash metal broke
                into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica, Slayer,
                Megadeth, and Anthrax, while other extreme subgenres such as
                death metal and black metal remain subcultural phenomena.

                Country is a genre of popular music that originated with blues,
                church music such as Southern gospel and spirituals, old-time,
                and American folk music forms including cowboy Western music
                styles of New Mexico, and Texas country. Its popularized roots
                originate in the Southern and Southwestern United States of the
                early 1920s. Country music often consists of ballads and dance
                tunes with generally simple forms, folk lyrics, and harmonies
                often accompanied by string instruments such as banjos, electric
                and acoustic guitars, steel guitars as well as harmonicas. The
                term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference
                to hillbilly music; it came to encompass Western music, which
                evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots. The term
                country music is used today to describe many styles and
                subgenres. The origins of country music are found in the folk
                music of working class Americans and blue-collar American life

                Electro house is a genre of electronic dance music characterized
                by heavy bass and a tempo around 130 beats per minute. Its
                origins were influenced by tech house and electro. The term has
                been used to describe the music of many DJs, including Alan
                Walker, Avicii, Skrillex, and Steve Aoki. Electro-house is
                typified by its heavy bass. This is often in the form of buzzing
                basslines. It is also often in the form of large bass drum

                Classical music is a term that most commonly refers to the
                formal musical tradition of the Western world, considered to be
                distinct from Western folk music or popular music traditions.
                Originated in Western Europe during the Middle Ages, it is
                classified into eras: the Medieval (500–1400), Renaissance
                (1400–1600), Baroque (1600–1750), Classical (1750–1820),
                Romantic (1800–1910), Modernist (1890–1975) and
                Postmodern/Contemporary (1950–present) eras. The term "classical
                music" did not appear until the early 19th century, in an
                attempt to distinctly canonize the period from Johann Sebastian
                Bach to Ludwig van Beethoven as a golden age. One distinguishing
                feature of Western classical music is its use of staff notation,
                in use since about the 11th century. Classical music has been
                noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of
                instrumental music such as the symphony, concerto, fugue,
                sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera,
                cantata, and mass.
